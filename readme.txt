== Installation ==

1. Login to your Conversion Support account at http://login.conversionsupport.com/. If you haven't created an account yet, get started here - http://www.conversionsupport.com/sign-up.html.

2. Go to the Settings section and copy your unique WordPress URL. Keep this URL handy, you will need it soon.

3. Download Conversion Support's WordPress plugin, it contains a zip file which you can unpack using any archiving utility such as  winzip.

4. Login to your website's FTP server and upload the "ConversionSupport" folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

Don't have an FTP client installed? No problem, you can upload the plugin within your WordPress administration area ( WordPress > Dashboard > Plugins > Upload).

Alternatively, login to your WordPress administration area with a user account that has administrative privileges. Go to Dashboard > Plugins > Add new, and search for "Conversion Support" (without quotes). In the search results page, click "Install now" next to the "Conversion Support" result. Now WordPress will automatically download the plugin's file on your web server, unpack it and activate it.

5. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

6. Go to Wordpress > Settings -> and choose -> Conversion Support.

7. Remember you copied your unique WordPress URL in step 2? Copy the same URL in the Conversion Support settings page, within your website's WordPress administration area.

8. Click "Save Changes" and its done. You have successfully installed Conversion Support on your website and now you're ready to initiate live web chats with website visitors.

9. To let users initiate chats with your support agents, you may want to add a "Start live chat" icon on your WordPress theme. To do this, go to Appearance within your WordPress administration area and choose "Widgets"

10. Drag the "Conversion Support" widget into any widgetized section of your site's theme.

11. All done!

My theme does not support widgets. How do I place the "Start chat" icon at a custom location?

Just place this code where you want the "Start chat" button to appear in your website's template:

<a class="chatIcon" href="javascript:void(0);" id="chat" style="cursor: pointer;">
<img src="http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/conversionsupportimages/conversionsupportimages/cvstartchat2.png" height="49" border="0" width="203">
</a>

Note: Keep the class name "chatIcon"; if you want to style it, use a parent div tag but keep the class name "chatIcon" as it is.

11. To test it out, view your website. There should be a "Start Chat" button, clicking which will initiate a new chat session.
